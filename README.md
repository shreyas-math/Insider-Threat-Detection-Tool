# Insider Threat Detection Tool (CDAC Project)

A Python-based security monitoring tool designed to detect and log potential insider threats. Events are logged to an SQLite database, logs are refreshed in real-time. This version features a **Modern GUI**, real-time pop-up alerts, and smart log management. It tracks sensitive file access, off-hour activity, USB insertions, and suspicious processes.

## 🚀 Features
